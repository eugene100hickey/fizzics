We use [LabVIEW from National Instruments](https://www.ni.com/en-ie/shop/labview.html) to make virtual instruments. Some of the laboratory assignments we do can be seen [here](LabVIEW_2021.pdf){target="_blank"} 

The labs include:  

- making a LabVIEW thermometer and measuring the rise time of a thermocouple  
- examining the frequency spectrum of various sounds  

- verifying Nyquist Theorem and observing the effects of signal aliasing  

- using USB to connect an oscilloscope to a LabVIEW programme  

- PID control of a tank fill system
