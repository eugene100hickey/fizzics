I teach physics to 1st Year Sports Science students. This is primarily biomechanics; kicking-off with linear motion, then progressing to circular motion, before finishing with a section on vectors.  

During COVID19 lockdown we put together a series of online experiments for the students. These can be seen [here](physics-labs/lab-list.html). They use simulations from [PHET Colorado](https://phet.colorado.edu/)
