I teach Manufacturing Technology to 4th Year Pharmaceutical Science students. This involves lots of chemical engineering, and my favourite part which is crystallography. The chemical engineering part looks at _material balances_, _heat exchangers_, and _distillation columns_. In crystallography, we go the way from _Bravais Lattices_, to _Miller Indices_, _Space Groups_, and _X-ray Diffraction_. 

The laboratory component of this module uses a Process Simulator programme [UniSim490 from Honeywell](https://www.honeywellprocess.com/en-US/explore/products/advanced-applications/unisim/Pages/default.aspx). We use this to set up virtual processes and compare their operation to theory. Examples of the labs from 2019 are given [here](ManTech_Lab_Manual_2019.pdf).
