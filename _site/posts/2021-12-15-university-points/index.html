<p>We looked at <a href="https://fizzics.netlify.app/posts/2021-12-06-university-choices/">university choices</a> last week, and the way in which different third level courses have different entry requirements. Using the same data, I thought it might be fun to see which were the most sought after universities. It’s also an excuse to play with <a href="https://github.com/AllanCameron/geomtextpath">geomtextpath</a>, a package I haven’t used before but that looks like it has some nifty features for <code>ggplot2</code> work.</p>
<p>We get the data as in the <a href="https://fizzics.netlify.app/posts/2021-12-06-university-choices/">university choices</a> post.</p>
