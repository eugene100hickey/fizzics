Research-wise, I work in data science, mostly astrophysics or neuroscience. My original background was in materials science, making new inter-metallic compounds based on uranium and looking at their structural and physical properties at temperatures down to 2.2K. I then spent some time as a medical physicist, developing teleradiology systems. But then discovered R programming about 2015 and haven’t looked back since.\r\nThis blog is an eclectic mix of posts featuring stuff I find interesting. I’ve have a fondness for maps, and specifically coordinate transformations, and especially maps of my home turf of Donegal. Over the years, I’ve spent a lot of time on golf courses, volleyball courts, and tennis courts, so they feature here too. I’m involved in politics. And of course there will be plenty of physics, and not just the astrophysics / neuroscience / bioinformatics stuff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLoading my github calendar data.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can find me at …\r\n\r\n\r\neugene100hickey\r\n\r\neugene100hickey\r\n\r\neugene.hickey@tudublin.ie\r\n\r\nDepartment of Applied ScienceTechnological University Dublin,TallaghtD24FKT9Ireland\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can also find me at various conferences and events. I’m a regular at the NHSr Community Conferences, involved with WhyR! and various meetups in Dublin (or other chapters sometimes). And I’m now using Mastodon quite a bit, rather than the other thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
